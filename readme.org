** Purpose
This provides everything needed to package an aws lambda function and some trivial python (with some marginally less trivial packages) to show off end-to-end nix lambda packaging.
** Prerequisites
- [[https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-quick-install][Nix]]
- [[https://direnv.net][direnv]] (be certain to include the [[https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html][direnv hook]] for your shell)
- [[https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv][nix-direnv]]
- docker (for running the image locally)
** Building
- Clone the repository
- run the following in the repo base directory to give direnv permission:
#+begin_src shell
direnv allow
#+end_src
- to package the python library, run the following:
#+begin_src shell
nix-build
#+end_src
- to package the docker container, run the following on a compatible target platform (linux x86_64 gnu)
#+begin_src shell
nix-build docker.nix
#+end_src
The target lambda container will be at ~result~.
** Running
- The target lambda can be pushed to the container service of choice and run within an aws lambda.
- To run locally, follow the instructions at [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-test.html#images-test-limitations][aws docs]] to run the container via the  lambda runtime emulator
